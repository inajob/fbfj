In Japan, MakerChip is a very hot trend among 3D printer owners.

A MakerChip is coin shaped items, 40mm in diameter and 3mm depth. People use these chips as business cards.

The [Japan RepRap Festival](https://www.japanreprapfestival.com/) is a key factor driving this trend.

This event will be held on June 14th and 15th.

You can find many MakerChips on [this page](https://scrapbox.io/fab-wiki/MakerChip).
